const DESCRIPTION_EXAMPLE = `Palmer Luckey explains why science fiction is a great place to look for ideas

"One of the things that I've realized in my career is that nothing I ever come up with will be new. I've literally never come up with an idea that a science fiction author has not come up with before."

Palmer continues:

"It makes sense. There's a lot of [science fiction authors]. They've been around for a long time. And they don't have to make things. And they don't have to wait for the right moment. I started Oculus at just the right moment for it to succeed. But a science fiction author doesn't have to wait for something to be possible to think about it and to write about it and for people to be excited about the idea. And so every time I've come up with something, I've been able to find -- usually many, sometimes one --  science fiction pieces addressing literally exactly that idea by some guy who just thought about it like 50 years ago."

He gives a few examples:

"Some of the stuff that I'm building today, for example, in the AR/VR space around augmenting the vision of soldiers -- these are ideas that are from 1959 Starship Troopers novels. These are old ideas that have only recently become technologically feasible. The idea of autonomous fighter jets, that's been around for about 100 years... people have been thinking about this since computers were programmed with punchcards."

So if you're having a hard time thinking of startup ideas, try reading science fiction.

      IMPORTANT RULES:
      1. Each key moment MUST be around 3 minutes long (180 seconds Â± 45 seconds)
      2. Start and end times MUST align with actual speech segments
      3. Start time MUST be at the beginning of a sentence
      4. End time MUST be at the end of a sentence
      5. Total video duration: ${Math.round(totalDuration)} seconds
      6. SKIP ANY MOMENTS THAT ARE ABOUT THE HOST/PRESENTER/INTERVIEWER
      7. Focus ONLY on the guest's most interesting, emotional, or important moments

      For each key moment, analyze:
      1. The start time (in seconds) - MUST be at the start of a sentence
      2. The end time (in seconds) - MUST be at the end of a sentence
      3. A clear description of what happens in this moment

      Make sure:
      - Timestamps are accurate and align with actual speech segments
      - Descriptions are concise but informative
      - Each moment captures a complete thought or discussion
      - Moments don't overlap
      - Moments are chronologically ordered
      - Each moment is approximately 3 minutes long (180 seconds)

      Skip moments that:
      - Are about the host/presenter/interviewer
      - Are not particularly interesting, emotional, or important to the overall narrative
      - Are just introductions, transitions, or technical setup
      - Are significantly shorter or longer than 3 minutes

      I only want UP TO 3 key moments (could be less, but not more).

      Here is an example of the point 3. clear descriptions of the key moments: ${DESCRIPTION_EXAMPLE}.

      You should write the description like the example above.

      Even including the transcription if it's relevant to the key moments.

      Podcast transcript:
      ${JSON.stringify(relevantTranscriptionData)}

      If the transcript is in french, write the descriptions in french.
      If the transcript is in english, write the descriptions in english.
